/// * my cat ran under the couch
/// * black cats are mysterious
/// * the dog scared the black cat

/// Of these two documents, (b) will rank more highly than (a) because it contains the nonrequired term black.
/// Even though document (c) contains both black and cat, it isnâ€™t considered a match because it contains the disallowed term dog.
